1a Proposal Draft:



Overall:  80/100



General comments:



Are you really going to setup PayPal?  If so, great. If not, could use Shopify..... (talk to me about this).



The structure of the proposal is not as specified in the requirements (data, function, network, People, timing, motivation sections plus detailed schedule).



Your schedule has a good level of detail, and the data model seems to be in good shape.



Details:

Data  => nice.  also note resource bundles and/or cookies, etc.





Function =>  You have this well described throughout.



Location/Network => servers on cloud is target?  mobile clients with browser, etc.



People  => who does admin access?  What are admin functions?  



Timing => was expecting the internal timing of the functions (e.g., live updates visible upon submission).  No delays.



Motivation  -> What about privacy? 



Project Plan => could use more detail re. what will be the vertical slice of the project that will be in each release.

Try to finish features completely rather than just individual components.
